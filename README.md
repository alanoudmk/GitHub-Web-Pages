# GitHub Web Pages

GitHub Pages is a feature provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It's a simple and free way to publish your website on the web.

To get started with GitHub Pages, you'll need to:
1. Create a new GitHub repository named username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username.
2. Add your website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages for your repository in the settings.
4. (Optional) Connect a custom domain to your GitHub Pages website.

Once your website is set up, whenever you push changes to your repository, GitHub Pages will automatically update your live website. This makes it a convenient and hassle-free way to host and publish your static websites.

GitHub Pages is often used for personal websites, project websites, documentation sites, and blogs, as it provides a simple and free solution for hosting these types of websites.

## Steps to Create a GitHub Pages website:

### 1. Create a GitHub Account: 
- If you don't have one already, go to GitHub.com and sign up for a free account.

### 2. Create a new repository:
- Log in to your GitHub account and click on the "+" icon in the top right corner.
- Select ``New repository`` from the dropdown menu.
- Choose a repository name following the format ``username.github.io``, where username is your GitHub username.
- Select ``Public`` for the repository visibility.
- Check the ``Initialize this repository with a README`` option.
- Click ``Create repository``.


### 3. Create your web content:
- In your repository, click on the ``Add file`` button and select ``Create new file``.
- Name the file ``index.html`` and add your ``HTML`` content. This will be the ``main page`` of your website.
- Alternatively, you can create your website locally using your preferred ``text editor``, and then ``push`` the files to your GitHub repository.


### 4. Enable GitHub Pages:
- In your repository, go to the ``Settings`` tab.
- Scroll down to the ``GitHub Pages`` section.
- Under ``Source``, select the ``master`` branch (or the branch you want to use for your website).
- Click ``Save`` to enable GitHub Pages.


### 5. Verify your website:
- After a few minutes, your website should be available at ``https://username.github.io``, where username is your GitHub username.
- You can check the status of your website deployment in the ``GitHub Pages`` section of your repository settings.

That's it! You've now created a GitHub Pages website. You can continue to update your website by adding more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your repository, and the changes will be reflected on your live website.


### 6. Here are some additional tips:
- You can customize the appearance of your website by adding a CSS file.
- You can add interactivity to your website by including JavaScript files.
- You can create additional pages by adding more HTML files to your repository.
- You can use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages website by configuring it in the repository settings.

Remember, GitHub Pages is a simple and free way to host your static website. It's a great option for personal, project, or small business websites.
